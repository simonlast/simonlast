Billy is a tiny, visually-oriented programming language for children.


Using a subset of English, users can manipulate and interact with geometric shapes, generating a dynamic artwork, or telling a story.


The goal of the project is to create a very small, easy-to-understand set of features which can combine to create complex and fun interactions.
