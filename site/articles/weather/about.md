What if you could tell the weather from people's tweets?

This experiment aggregates filtered tweets in realtime, with the goal of being able to give a sense of the current weather throughout the country. Yellow circles mean nice weather, blue mean rain. Scroll over one to see the original tweet.


TweetWeather is no longer live, unfortunately. If you'd really like to see it live, contact me.
