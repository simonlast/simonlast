Peer Puzzle is an experiment in realtime collaboration using mobile devices.


A common focus in modern technologies is their ability to enable people to communicate remotely. However, these same technologies *could* be used for the exact opposite.
The goal of this experiment is to use mobile devices to set up an limited medium for communication, and use it as scaffolding for people to use traditional means of communicaton to solve a shared problem.


Peer Puzzle is intended for mobile devices, but works on any device with an accelerometer.
